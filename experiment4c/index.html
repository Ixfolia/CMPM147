				<h2><br>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?
					<br>This simple generated world is used to simulate 3D terrain in a grassy environment.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used Perlin noise to generate water tiles by using a noise threshold.
					Tiles above the threshold are water tiles and below are grass/land tiles.
					When generating water, it may have a chance to display a wave image momentarily.
					On land tiles, users can click on them to raise a block of dirt on it and changing the color to simulate a 3D elevation effect.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Although this one is super simple, I really enjoyed trying to make the 3D blocks work.
					Though there are some flaws, I think it looks alright and actually looks like it's stacking blocks on each other.
				</p>

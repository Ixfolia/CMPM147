				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I wanted to copy the initial image of the ocean with bubbles and corals.
					<br>
				<img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/c55ce01e-b518-4158-8e4d-15362927df6c/underwaterbubbles.jpg?v=1713220889502", width="500">

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Relation to inspiring image:
					<br>
					<br>
					<b>Color</b>: Used a color dropper tool from https://imagecolorpicker.com/en. The seabed color was a random brown color that I picked.
					<br>
					<b>Primitives</b>: The bubbles and sand were created using the ellipse function.
					<br>
					<b>Polygons</b>: The moving waves at the top were created using beginShape and endShape.
					<br>
					<b>Composition</b>: The bubbles have a random seed generated on the canvas, moving upwards. The waves move left and right randomly.
					<br>
					<b>Life</b>: It's supposed to simulate the ocean seabed, and the bubbles move upward to show bubbles in the ocean. The waves are meant to show the surface of the ocean.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was a pretty fun project to work on since we can choose any image and build off of it. 
					However, my partner ChatGPT definitely did most of the heavy lifting, helping me simulate the moving bubbles. 
					I wanted to create the corals/rocks in the picture but I wasn't sure how to generate them in a more natural way. 
					I like the results but it can be better.</p>

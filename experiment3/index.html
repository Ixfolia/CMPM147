				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I'm trying to make an overworld and dungeon tile generator where it generates a random map.
				   Can toggle between overworld and dungeon with "change world".</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<br>
				<b>Tileset Image</b>: Used this <a href="https://cdn.glitch.com/25101045-29e2-407a-894c-e0243cd8c7c6%2Ftileset.png?v=1611654020439">tileset</a> from glitch.com 
				<li>It's supposed to be a mixture of grass, dirt, trees, houses and mountains</li>
				<li>Reseeding will randomize the tiles with grass and dirt having a small chance to become a house or a tree instead.</li>
				<li>"change world" button will switch between overworld and the dungeon</li>
				<li>The dungeon layout is the same every generation but chest locations and deadend walls are randomized.</li>

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Although this experiment was pretty hard, I was pretty proud of myself when I managed to make the tile generation work.
				   Adding houses, trees and mountains have made it more lively. 
				   Those features alongside animated water sometimes made really beautiful generations.
				   The dungeon was the most difficult part for me. 
				   I tried making individual rooms with different sizes which worked but creating the hallways and connecting them to each other was super difficult for me.
				   I ended up making a static dungeon layout with randomized chests and deadends.
				   Another issue that came up was the background of the tree tile. I'm not sure how to change it to look like the grass tiles.

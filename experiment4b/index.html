				<h2><br><br>Description</h2>
				<p>Experiment 4b shows an infinite generated world, showing that of a beach alongside some trees and rocks.
				   The darker blue parts of the water represents deeper water and it gradually lightens up as it gets closer to land.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used noise to change the depth of the water, affecting the color of the tile and showing between shallow and deep water.
					Water with an elevation below certain threshold are counted as deep water.
					Higher threshold equals sand. 
					Trees and rocks are based on their own hash values, with trees only placed on sand tiles while rocks have a low chance to be on a water tile.
					Crabs are spawned in using the global crabs array and it's also used to check their coordinates.
					After checking the coordinates, it sees if the crabs can move to adjacent tiles.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>4b was a bit harder than 4a as I had to make the transition from water to sand.
					Not only that, I had to figure out how to make the crabs move around as well.
					However, I think it's the best looking world out of the three worlds.

				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					I'm trying to create a generator that evolves images. 
					The images are made up of a series of shapes, each with a random color, position, and size. 
					The generator starts with a random population of images and then evolves them over time to match a target image.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					Each image is made up of a series of shapes, each with a random color, position, and size. 
					The generator starts with a random population of images and then evolves them over time to match a target image. 
					Each generation, the generator selects the images that are closest to the target image and uses them to create a new population of images. 
					The new population is created by randomly mutating the selected images. 
					The generator continues to evolve the images until it finds an image that matches the target image.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I had a rough time with this because I had an error telling me about a circular function and something about JSON. It took me a
					while to fix it. I think there can be a little more polish to the evolved images and it wasn't as good at I thought.

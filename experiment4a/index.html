				<h2><br>Description</h2>
				<p>An infinite world showing grassland, water and a forest slowly growing and taking over everything</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>When a tile is clicked, it places a patch of dirt on the ground.
				    Trees gradually spawn across a grid using a using Perlin noise. 
					Initially, a high treeSpawnThreshold limits tree presence, but this threshold decreases over time, allowing more trees to appear. 
					It creates a natural and evolving landscape where tree growth is based on random noise.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.
				   <br>
				   This one was pretty interesting as I was trying to replicate sort of a forest growing overtime.
				   I liked making the tree populatioon slowly go from nothing to taking over the entire grid.
